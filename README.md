# Luna.js

Eventually this will be a framework for designing and building JS games for beginners with ideas and little programming knowledge (like I once was [or maybe still am]). I'm mostly still learning JS, so if I'm having a problem (help-wanted) feel free to help out!

Even if you can't code, if you think of a feature I should add before release, comment on the Planned Features issue!
